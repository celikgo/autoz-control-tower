# Architecture Documentation

## Overview
Multi-Cluster Manager follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.

## Components

### CLI Layer
- Command parsing and validation
- Output formatting and user interaction
- Configuration management

### Business Logic Layer
- Cluster connection management
- Workload operations
- Multi-cluster coordination

### Infrastructure Layer
- Kubernetes API integration
- Configuration file handling
- Network communication

## Design Principles
1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Testability**: All components can be unit tested in isolation
3. **Extensibility**: New cluster types and operations can be added easily
4. **Performance**: Parallel operations and connection pooling
5. **Reliability**: Graceful error handling and recovery
